  Our project is a two-player implementation of chess. It supports both normal
  chess and pawn chess. It operates fully inside of the terminal within a text-based
  user interface. The TUI has multiple options for board color schemes and is
  manipulated using user-inputted strings (for example, "A2 A3" moves the piece
  at coordinate A2 to coordinate A3, if legal). The game includes a full implementation
  of the chess rule set, to include piece movement, capturing, promotions, en passant
  capturing, and castling, in addition to being able to recognize stalemates.
